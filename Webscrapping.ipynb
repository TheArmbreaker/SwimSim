    "## General thoughts on ethics of webscrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter a website called [swimrankings.net](https://www.swimrankings.net/) is scrapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web crawlers or scrapping are boon and bane for website operators. On the one hand they need crawlers - especially Google's - to search and classify the websites' content. On the other hand webscrapping leads to increased website traffic and thus increased costs for operators. The robots.txt for swimrankings.net blocks crawlers who are not from Google. And they have scrapping protection in place. The screenshot shows that an empty page was returned, after I accidentaly run the code cell and a lot of requests in short time where send to the websites host.\n",
    "\n",
    "![empty page](pictures/empty_page_swimrankings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while the side loaded again and asked if I am a robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![not a robot](pictures/not_a_robot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is the website's exclusiv content and has to be respected as well as the fact that the website seems to finance itself with Google Ads and showing those ads to real people, not to Beautiful Soup. This is a small insight on ethical issues when performing webscrapping, because such a website might not be financially well provided to deal with traffic from being a constant webscrapping target.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this learning project the running time of the scrapping code is less important than the risk of having no data. Therefore and while having the ethical issues in mind the scrapping code was executed only once with several hours of time running. However the code is implemented in way that much more data (e.g. from seasons or athletes) could have been requested, but the approach \"only take what you need\" was performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To behave like a human and to achieve the ridicoulous long time running the code is written with time.sleep and randint functions. This leads in worst case (if always the highest randint would be waited) to a time of 4.5 hours. This approach was chosen because in that time a human might has copied the data manually while ignoring the adds. Additionally different userAgents for BeautifulSoup are chosen with random.choice."

    "\n",
    "Following Screenshot shows that each Top 100 lists consists of two tables which can be identified by the html-table-class \"athleteList\". After finding the tables with class \"athleteList\" a function is called to save *name, year of birth, nationality and a website-specific swimmer id* in a list of dicts.

Somehow this parser returned code not as expected from examination in Google Chrome. Switching to lxml provided much cleaner code snippets for scrapping.\n",

    "The reason for this still has to be researched. First idea is that html.parser did not favore the nested table structures for unequal amounts of tables on each athletes side. The screenshot below shows the unusal table alignment for event results. This is different for every athlete, because it depends on the amount of data.\n",
